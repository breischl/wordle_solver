# wordle_solver
A set of scripts around solving the popular Wordle puzzle game. This is mostly a learning exercise for me - it's my first non-trivial Python script. Please judge the code quality accordingly. :) 

`python wordle.py` will choose a random word and the computer will play against itself.

`python adviser.py` will launch a simple console app that will advise you on what to guess, and accept results to update future guesses.
